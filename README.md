# Chaoting Sun

Software Engineer focused on backend systems, concurrency, and reliability.

Previously a Full-Stack Engineer at an AI design SaaS startup, where I worked on real-time collaboration and access control systems.  
Currently studying distributed system patterns by implementing them from scratch.

---

## Current Focus

I build small systems to understand failure, recovery, and consistency in real environments.

### async-task-queue
A Redis-based asynchronous task queue featuring:
- visibility timeout
- lease token ownership
- heartbeat extension
- crashed worker recovery (reaper)
- dead letter queue

The goal of this project is to understand how real job processing systems (e.g., background workers) handle worker crashes, retries, and duplicate execution.

### RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)
- permission hierarchy
- scalable permission checks
- multi-tenant support (1M+ users)
